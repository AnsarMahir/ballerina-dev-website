## Overview

The [Application component](https://quantil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of [QuAntiL](https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/projekte/quantil/) incorporates tools and quantum algorithm implementations tailored to address specific use cases. Notably, the [Quantum Humanities Analysis (QHAna)](https://quantil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/qhana/) features an intelligent tool set that employs machine-learning techniques compatible with classical and quantum hardware. Specifically created for integration with the [MUSE Repository](https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/INBOOK-2018-05-MUSE.pdf), it offers extensive techniques primarily focused on categorical data. The backend driving QHAna is developed using the Ballerina programming language.

## Challenges

Developing the QHAna backend presented several challenges that required careful consideration of effective solutions. Handling transactions within the backend posed complexities, as it involved managing multiple operations to maintain data consistency and reliability. Additionally, connecting QHAna backend services with a database proved to be a notable challenge, demanding the establishment of a seamless connection to ensure efficient data retrieval, storage, and management. Another significant challenge involved the integration of services easily and efficiently. QHAna's backend required a programming language that could simplify the creation of services, allowing for a modular and scalable architecture. Overcoming these challenges was crucial for the successful development of the QHAna backend.

## Solution

As illustrated in the diagram below, the solution encompasses the QHAna backend written in Ballerina, featuring two primary types of Ballerina APIs: `Plugin APIs` and `Experiment APIs`. This backend interfaces with the QHAna website, which serves as the front end and is expected to establish resilient communications with the SQLite database for data storage and retrieval.

## Benefits

The utilization of Ballerina in the QHAna backend yields a diverse set of benefits, effectively addressing challenges and elevating the overall development of the system. Ballerina's cloud-based integration capabilities play a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and consistency of QHAna's operations, even when transactions involve processes that are distributed across multiple database calls. Additionally, Ballerina's built-in support for database management contributed significantly to the accuracy and reliability of QHAna's machine-learning project management. Furthermore, Ballerina's syntax and framework allowed the QHAna backend to leverage Ballerina's language features in creating modular and well-structured services efficiently. 

## Conclusion

By seamlessly integrating with QHAna, Ballerina demonstrates its capacity to proficiently manage the complexities of backend development, providing a robust foundation for the intricate demands of quantum humanities analysis. The symbiotic relationship between the two not only emphasizes the language's adaptability but also its pivotal role in contributing to the reliability and scalability essential for the success of advanced analytical processes within the realm of quantum humanities.
