## Ballerina library updates

### New features

#### `persist` package
- Incorporated support for the `PostgreSQL` data store, mirroring the functionality provided for other supported SQL data stores like `MySQL` and `MSSQL`.
- Implemented support for the `Redis` data store, including the following features:
  - Supported optional fields to be defined in the data model, providing flexibility in structuring data.
  - Supported connection configuration to be defined as separate parameters or as a URI
  - Supported Redis data store to be used as a cache or as a persistent store.

  >**Info:** The Redis database support is an experimental feature. APIs might change in future releases.

- Added support for the following annotations within the `persist.sql` package to facilitate entity mapping alongside additional SQL database features.
  - `@sql:Name` - Map an entity name to a specific table name and a field name to a specific column name.
  - `@sql:Varchar` - Give a specific VARCHAR length. 
  - `@sql:Char` - Give a specific CHAR length. 
  - `@sql:Decimal` - Give specific DECIMAL precision and scale. 
  - `@sql:Index` - Declare an index field.
  - `@sql:UniqueIndex` - Declare a unique index field.
  - `@sql:Relation` - Declare a relation field. This is used to define a foreign key relationship between two entities.
  - `@sql:Generated` - Declare a generated field. This is used to define a field that is generated by the database.

#### `uuid` package
- Implemented support for generating random UUIDs in an intuitive manner through the `uuid:createRandomUuid` function.

### Improvements

#### `mysql` package
- Specified SSL as the preferred option when users provide options without SSL configuration. Additionally, introduced support for explicitly disabling SSL.

### Deprecations

## Developer tools updates

### New features

#### Language Server

#### CLI

#### OpenAPI tool

#### Persist tool
- Modified the `persist init` command to solely create a `persist` directory within the Ballerina project and generate a new definition file (model.bal) within the `persist` directory if it doesn't already exist. It no longer updates the `Ballerina.toml` file with the persist configuration as it did previously.
- Modified the `persist generate` command to function as a one-time source code generation tool. Additionally, introduced the following new arguments to the persist generate command:
    - `--datastore` - This is used to indicate the preferred data store.
    - `--module` - This is used to indicate the module in which the files are generated.

  For example,

    ```bash
    $ bal persist generate --datastore mysql --module db
    ```

- Changed the `persist generate` command to generate all the Ballerina client, types, `db_config` files, and the script file in the specified module directory allowing the user to commit the generated source code along with the project source code.
- Introduced the new `persist add` command to initialize the `bal persist` in the Ballerina project and integrate the source code generation with the `bal build` command. This command will update the `Ballerina.toml` file with the `tool.persist` configuration and generate the `model.bal` file in the `persist` directory, if the file does not exist. This command supports the following arguments:
    - `--datastore` - This is used to indicate the preferred data store.
    - `--module` - This is used to indicate the module in which the files are generated.

  For example,

  ```bash
  $ bal persist add --datastore mysql --module db
  ```
- Implemented introspection support for existing databases to facilitate the generation of the persist data model. This functionality is accessible through the new `bal persist pull` command. The command is equipped with the following arguments:
    - `--datastore` - This is used to indicate the preferred data store.
    - `--host` - This is used to indicate the host of the database.
    - `--port` - This is used to indicate the port of the database.
    - `--user` - This is used to indicate the username of the database.
    - `--database` - This is used to indicate the database name.

  For example,
    
  ```bash
  $ bal persist pull --datastore mysql --host localhost --port 3306 --user root --database test
  ```
  >**Info:** The database introspection support is an experimental feature and currently only supports MySQL databases. The commands associated with the feature might change in future releases.
