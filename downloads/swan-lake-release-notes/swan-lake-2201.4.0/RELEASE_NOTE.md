## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake 2201.4.0

<em>2201.4.0 (Swan Lake) is the fourth major release of 2022, and it includes a new set of features and significant improvements to the compiler, runtime, standard library, and developer tooling. It is based on the 2022R5 version of the Language Specification.</em> 

## Update Ballerina

**If you are already using Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run either of the commands below to directly update to 2201.4.0 using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/cli-documentation/update-tool/).

`bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.4.0`)

**If you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run the commands below to update to 2201.4.0.

1. Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.

2. Run `bal dist update` ( or `bal dist pull 2201.4.0`) to update your Ballerina version to 2201.4.0.

However, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.4.0`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/swan-lake-2201.0.0#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.

## Install Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

## Migrate from Swan Lake Beta releases
>**Info:** If you have been using Swan Lake Beta releases, delete the `Dependencies.toml` files in your Ballerina packages when migrating to Ballerina 2201.4.0 (Swan Lake). 

A few backward-incompatible changes have been introduced during the Swan Lake Beta program, and thereby, some of your existing packages may not compile with Ballerina 2201.4.0 (Swan Lake). Therefore, you need to delete the `Dependencies.toml` file to force the dependency resolver to use the latest versions of your dependencies.
