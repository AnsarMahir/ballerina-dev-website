## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake 2201.3.1

<em>Swan Lake 2201.3.1 is the first patch release of Ballerina 2201.3.0 (Swan Lake Update 3) and it includes a new set of bug fixes to the language, language server, and developer tooling.</em>

## Update Ballerina

**If you are already using Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run either of the commands below to directly update to 2201.3.1 using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/cli-documentation/update-tool/).

`bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.3.1`)

**If you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run the commands below to update to 2201.3.1.

However, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.3.1`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/swan-lake-2201.0.0#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.
