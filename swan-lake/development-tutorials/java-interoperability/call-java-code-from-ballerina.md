## Ballerina bindings to Java code
You can write Ballerina code (Ballerina bindings) that lets you call the corresponding Java API as illustrated in the diagram below.

## Ballerina FFI

The [Ballerina FFI](/learn/ballerina-ffi) explains how to write the Ballerina bindings manually. Learning to write them manually helps you to understand the inner workings of calling Java from Ballerina. It is also a useful section for those who want to understand the inner workings of calling Java from Ballerina and for those who want to customize the bindings generated by [the Bindgen tool](#the-bindgen-tool).

## The Bindgen tool

Alternatively, you can use the [Bindgen tool](/learn/the-bindgen-tool/) to generate these bindings automatically while eliminating the need for understanding the Ballerina FFI layer. The `bindgen` is a CLI tool that eases the process of generating Ballerina bindings for given Java APIs. For more details on how the Bindgen tool works, see [The Bindgen tool](/learn/the-bindgen-tool/). It also explains how to customize the bindings generated by the Bindgen tool.

## Write Ballerina bindings

The [Package layout](/learn/package-references/#package-layout) explains how to package Java libraries (JAR files) with Ballerina programs to produce self-contained executable programs. When you generate bindings for a Java library using the Bindgen tool, this part is already handled.
