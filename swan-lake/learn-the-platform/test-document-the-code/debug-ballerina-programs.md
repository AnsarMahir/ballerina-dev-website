The Ballerina compiler comes in handy to detect syntax and semantic issues that occur in your code when developing large-scale applications with complex logic. However, it is difficult for the compiler to detect runtime errors like logical errors because they occur during the program execution after a successful compilation. This is where the dedicated debugging tooling support of Ballerina becomes important.

## Debugging sessions

The VS Code extension provides three types of sessions to debug your Ballerina code.

## Debugging features

The Ballerina VS Code extension provides a range of powerful debugging features. Developers can set breakpoints with conditions and logpoints, pause and continue program execution for precise inspection, evaluate expressions at runtime, and view call stacks and strands. These features enhance the debugging experience, enabling effective troubleshooting and analysis of Ballerina code.
