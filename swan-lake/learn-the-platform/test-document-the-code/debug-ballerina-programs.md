The Ballerina compiler comes in handy to detect syntax and semantic issues that occur in your code when developing large-scale applications with complex logic. However, it is difficult for the compiler to detect runtime errors like logical errors because they occur during the program execution after a successful compilation. This is where the dedicated debugging tooling support of Ballerina becomes important.
