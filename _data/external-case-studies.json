                "description": "At its core, the challenge of managing Human Resources data is an integration challenge: estimates range from 2-3 HR systems in use at a typical SMB, up to a few dozen systems implemented amongst enterprise HR departments, and these systems seldom integrate seamlessly between themselves. Providing a multi-tenant, cloud-native solution to integrate these hundreds of HR-related systems, normalize their disparate data models and then render that consolidated information for stakeholder decision making has been a substantial undertaking, but one significantly eased by leveraging Ballerina.",
