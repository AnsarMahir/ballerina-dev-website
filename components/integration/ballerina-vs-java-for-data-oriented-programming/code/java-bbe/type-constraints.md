title: 'Data validation at the boundary'
description: Boundary data validation is crucial for data-oriented programming. It ensures that only valid and reliable data enters the system, improving data integrity, downstream processing, and security. <br><br>Ballerina handles data validation automatically with its built-in language features. In Java, libraries like Hibernate Validator and Apache Commons Validator provide tools for enforcing validation rules.
